I have successfully updated the `crear-contrato` module.

Here's a summary of the changes:
- Created 16 new React components for advanced LegalTech features in `src/features/crear-contrato/components/`.
- Integrated these new components into `src/features/crear-contrato/CrearContratoPage.tsx` under a new "LegalTech Avanzado" section.
- Added new placeholder functions to `src/features/crear-contrato/crearContratoApi.ts` to simulate advanced LegalTech endpoints.
