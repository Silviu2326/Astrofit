Okay, I will create the specified structure and files for the CRM module. First, I'll create the necessary directories and then write each file with realistic mock data and functionality as requested.The `mkdir -p` command failed, likely due to Windows command syntax. I'll retry with a Windows-compatible `mkdir` command to create the necessary directories.Okay, directories are done. Now, creating `ClientesListadoPage.tsx`.I used a relative path, which was an error. I'll get the current directory, create an absolute path, and then use that with the `write_file` tool.Right, current directory is `C:\Users\usuario\Documents`. I'll build absolute paths and start creating the files.Creating `clientesListadoApi.ts`.Okay, `ClientesTable.tsx` is next.Okay, creating `ClientesFilters.tsx`.Okay, creating `ClientesActions.tsx`.
I have created the complete structure for the `CRM - Clientes Listado` module as requested.

Here is a summary of the created files:
- `src/features/clientes-listado/ClientesListadoPage.tsx`: The main page for the feature.
- `src/features/clientes-listado/clientesListadoApi.ts`: Contains mock data and a function to fetch it.
- `src/features/clientes-listado/components/ClientesTable.tsx`: A table to display the clients.
- `src/features/clientes-listado/components/ClientesFilters.tsx`: A component with filters for the client's table.
- `src/features/clientes-listado/components/ClientesActions.tsx`: A component with actions to perform on the clients.

Is there anything else I can help you with?
