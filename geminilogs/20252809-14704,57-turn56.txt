Okay, I will enhance the `tickets-diarios` module.

Here's my plan:
1.  Create the 16 new `.tsx` component files in `project/src/features/tickets-diarios/components/` with placeholder content.
2.  Read `project/src/features/tickets-diarios/TicketsDiariosPage.tsx` to prepare for integrating the new components.
3.  Read `project/src/features/tickets-diarios/ticketsDiariosApi.ts` to prepare for adding new endpoints.

I will start by creating the new component files.All 16 component files are created. Now, I'll read `TicketsDiariosPage.tsx` to understand its structure for integration.I have `TicketsDiariosPage.tsx` content. It imports `TablaTransacciones`, `ResumenVentas`, `FiltroPeriodo`, and `useTicketsDiarios`. I'll integrate the new "intelligent accounting" components by importing them and adding them sequentially after `TablaTransacciones` to `TicketsDiariosPage.tsx`.`TicketsDiariosPage.tsx` is updated. Next, I'll update `ticketsDiariosApi.ts` by reading its content to understand its structure and then adding new automated accounting API endpoints.I'll update `ticketsDiariosApi.ts`. I'll define new interfaces for intelligent accounting data, create mock data, and implement new functions (similar to `useTicketsDiarios`) to simulate API calls for fetching/posting this data. These functions will return mock data directly and will be added after the `useTicketsDiarios` hook.I've finished: 16 new component files, updated `TicketsDiariosPage.tsx` to display them, and modified `ticketsDiariosApi.ts` with new interfaces, mock data, and API functions. All paths are relative and within the project base. Now, I'll verify these changes by listing the `components` directory and reading the updated `TicketsDiariosPage.tsx` and `ticketsDiariosApi.ts`.Verification confirms: 16 new component files exist, `TicketsDiariosPage.tsx` renders them, and `ticketsDiariosApi.ts` includes new interfaces, mock data, and API functions. All tasks are complete.
