Okay, I will create the complete structure for the CRM Notes module.Okay, the directory already exists. I will now create the six specified files.I messed up. `write_file` needs an absolute path, not the relative one I used. I'll fix it by adding the current working directory to the path.Right, `pwd` isn't for Windows. I'll use `cd` to find the current directory.Right, current directory is `C:\Users\usuario\Documents`. I'll create absolute paths and write the files.Files created, content added, directory structured. Task complete.
