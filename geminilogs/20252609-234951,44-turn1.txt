Okay, I will create the complete structure for the CRM's "Client Detail" module. First, I'll create the necessary directories and then populate them with the specified files, including realistic mock data and component structure.

I will now create the directory `project-bolt-sb1-qekdxfwt/project/src/features/cliente-detalle/components`. This will ensure the nested structure is ready for the component files.The `mkdir` command failed due to a syntax error, likely because the `-p` flag is not universally supported on Windows systems. I will proceed by writing the files directly, as the file writing tool can typically create the necessary parent directories automatically.

I will now create all the specified files with the required content and structure.I have created the complete file and folder structure for the "Cliente Detalle" feature, as requested. All files have been populated with TypeScript code, React components, and TailwindCSS classes to meet the specified requirements. The mock data API is also in place to simulate a real backend.
