Okay, I will enhance the `project-bolt-sb1-qekdxfwt/project/src/features/historial-marcas/` module.

First, I will create the 16 new component files with basic React functional component structures.
My apologies, I made an error by using relative paths. I need to provide absolute paths for the `file_path` argument. I will correct this and create the files again.
All new component files are created. Now, I will read `HistorialMarcasPage.tsx` to understand its structure for integrating the new components.I'll integrate the new components into `HistorialMarcasPage.tsx`. I'll import all 16 components and render them in new sections within the main `div`, following the "Registro de PRs" section. I'll update `HistorialMarcasPage.tsx` now.`HistorialMarcasPage.tsx` is updated. Next, I'll read `historialMarcasApi.ts` to understand its structure and add advanced tracking endpoints.I'll update `historialMarcasApi.ts` by adding advanced tracking endpoints. This involves defining new interfaces for prediction, biomechanical analysis, and fatigue data, then extending `HistorialMarcasData` to include these. I'll create new mock data for each feature, integrate it into `useHistorialMarcas`, and add placeholder functions to simulate API calls for fetching this data. I'll begin with interfaces and mock data.I've completed the task: 16 new React components are created, `HistorialMarcasPage.tsx` is updated to render them, and `historialMarcasApi.ts` now includes new interfaces, extended data, mock data, and simulated API calls for advanced tracking. All changes are implemented.
