I will install the `reactflow` library as requested. This command will add the library to your project's dependencies.It seems the previous command failed because the directory path was incorrect. I will try again with the correct relative path to the project directory.

First, I'll install the library.Installation successful. Now I will check `package.json` to verify that `reactflow` has been added to the dependencies.It appears I made a typo in the file path. Let me correct it and read the `package.json` file again to verify the installation.The `reactflow` library has been successfully installed. It is now listed in your `package.json` file under dependencies with version `11.11.4`.
