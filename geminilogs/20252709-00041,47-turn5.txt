I'll create the directories individually.Okay, `tareas` exists. Now, create `components` inside.Okay, directories are done. Time to create `TareasPage.tsx`.Right, relative path was wrong. I'll use the absolute path for this and all future files.Okay, creating `tareasApi.ts` with mock data.Okay, creating `TareasList.tsx`.Okay, I'm creating the `TareaForm.tsx` component.Okay, creating `TareaCard.tsx` now.Okay, creating `TareasFilters.tsx`.
