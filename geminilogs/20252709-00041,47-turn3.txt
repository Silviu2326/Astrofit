Okay, I will create the complete structure for the CRM Segments module.

First, I'll create the necessary directories. I'll use `run_shell_command` to create the nested directories `project-bolt-sb1-qekdxfwt/project/src/features/segmentos/components`. This command will create the full path, including parent directories if they don't exist.The `mkdir -p` command failed, likely due to the Windows environment. I will use the appropriate command for Windows to create the directories.Okay, the directories are ready. Now I'll create the `SegmentosPage.tsx` file, which will be the main component for the page, managing state and orchestrating the other components.I used a relative path instead of an absolute one. I'll fix that by adding the current working directory to the path and retry the file write.Okay, I'm creating `segmentosApi.ts`. It'll handle mock data, simulate API calls for segment lists and member previews, and define `Segmento` and `Regla` types.Okay, I'm creating the `SegmentosList.tsx` component. It will fetch and display segments from the API, with buttons for creating and editing.Okay, I'm building `SegmentoBuilder.tsx`. It's a form for defining segment rules with name/description inputs, a dynamic rule list, and save functionality. It will also include the `SegmentoPreview` and `SegmentoActions` components.Okay, I'm creating the `SegmentoPreview.tsx` component. It's a small, real-time counter of members matching rules, and it will be embedded in the `SegmentoBuilder`.Okay, creating `SegmentoActions.tsx`. It'll have placeholder buttons for segment actions like export, tag, and delete.I've created the specified file and directory structure for the `segmentos` feature, following all project conventions and including mock data. Now, I'll create the `types.ts` file to centralize the feature's type definitions.Okay, `types.ts` is done. I'll update `SegmentosPage.tsx` and `segmentosApi.ts` to import types from it, starting with `SegmentosPage.tsx`.`SegmentosPage.tsx` already imports `Segmento` from `./types`, my mistake. Now checking `segmentosApi.ts` for necessary updates.`segmentosApi.ts` has redundant type definitions. I'll remove them and import from `types.ts` to centralize types and improve maintainability.Okay, time to check type imports in other files, starting with `SegmentosList.tsx`.`SegmentosList.tsx` currently imports `Segmento` from `../segmentosApi`. I'll change that to import from `../types` for better code organization.`SegmentoBuilder.tsx` next.Okay, I'm updating `SegmentoBuilder.tsx`. I'll import `Segmento`, `GrupoReglas`, and `Regla` from `../types` instead of `../segmentosApi`, but I'll keep importing `fetchSegmentoPreview` from `../segmentosApi`.
I have created all the requested files and directories for the CRM Segments module.

-   **Created Directories:**
    -   `project-bolt-sb1-qekdxfwt/project/src/features/segmentos/`
    -   `project-bolt-sb1-qekdxfwt/project/src/features/segmentos/components/`

-   **Created Files:**
    -   `SegmentosPage.tsx`: The main page for the feature.
    -   `segmentosApi.ts`: Contains mock data and simulated API calls.
    -   `types.ts`: Centralized type definitions for the feature.
    -   `components/SegmentosList.tsx`: Displays the list of segments.
    -   `components/SegmentoBuilder.tsx`: The form for creating/editing segments.
    -   `components/SegmentoPreview.tsx`: Shows a preview of segment members.
    -   `components/SegmentoActions.tsx`: Provides actions for segments.

-   **Code Quality:**
    -   Used TypeScript, React, and functional components with hooks.
    -   Included placeholders for TailwindCSS classes.
    -   Provided realistic mock data.
    -   Followed the existing project structure.
    -   Centralized type definitions in `types.ts` for better maintainability.

The structure is now complete and follows the specified requirements.
