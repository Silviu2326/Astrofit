I am unable to create directories using the available `run_shell_command` tool on this Windows environment. The `mkdir` command, even with various attempts (bash `mkdir`, `cmd /c mkdir`, with and without quotes, with simple and complex paths), consistently returns an error indicating incorrect file or directory syntax.

Therefore, I cannot proceed with creating the specified folder structure and files.
