I have created and updated the following files:

1.  `src/features/agente-entrenador/components/builder/ConstructorVisual.tsx`
2.  `src/features/agente-entrenador/components/builder/BloquesEntrenamiento.tsx`
3.  `src/features/agente-entrenador/components/builder/SuperseriesManager.tsx`

These files implement the training builder components with features such as drag & drop, modular blocks, superseries editor with timers, real-time preview, estimated time calculation, and placeholders for muscle balance validation, predefined templates, and PDF export.
