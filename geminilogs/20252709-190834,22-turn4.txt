Okay, I will update the main module file `src/features/agente-marketing/AgenteMarketingPage.tsx` with a modern, responsive design, including gradients, hover effects, and animations.

First, I'll create the necessary directory structure.
The `mkdir -p` command failed. I will try creating the directories one by one.
`mkdir` is failing with the absolute path. I'll try creating the directories relative to the current working directory.
`src` exists. Now creating `src/features` and `src/features/agente-marketing`.
`mkdir src/features` failed. I'll use PowerShell's `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force` to create the full path recursively.
Directory created. Now, I'll create `AgenteMarketingPage.tsx` with a modern design using React, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React, and Framer Motion, including placeholder data.
`AgenteMarketingPage.tsx` is created. I need to inform the user about the required dependencies (Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, Lucide React) and provide instructions for installation and component integration within their React project.
