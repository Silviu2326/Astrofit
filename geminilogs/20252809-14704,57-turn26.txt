Okay, I will create the new component files and then update `EmpleadosSociosPage.tsx` and `empleadosSociosApi.ts`.

Here's the plan:
1. Create the new component files with basic React functional component structures.
2. Read `EmpleadosSociosPage.tsx` to understand how to integrate the new components.
3. Read `empleadosSociosApi.ts` to understand how to add new endpoints.

Let's start by creating the new component files.New component files are done. Now, I'll update `EmpleadosSociosPage.tsx` and `empleadosSociosApi.ts`. Starting with `EmpleadosSociosPage.tsx` to understand its structure for component integration.Got `EmpleadosSociosPage.tsx` content. I'll import and render the new components within a new, organized section below `TablaBeneficiarios`.`EmpleadosSociosPage.tsx` is done. Next, I'll update `empleadosSociosApi.ts` with new RRHH and utilization report endpoints. I'll start by reading the file to understand its current structure.I'll update `empleadosSociosApi.ts` by adding mock API functions for RRHH integration and utilization reports. This includes new interfaces for `RRHHData` and `UtilizationReport`, corresponding mock data, and functions like `fetchRRHHData`, `fetchUtilizationReport`, and `updateEmployeeStatus`. These will be appended to the file.New component files created. `EmpleadosSociosPage.tsx` and `empleadosSociosApi.ts` updated. All changes implemented.
