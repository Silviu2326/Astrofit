I have successfully created the following files and directories for the Wearables Data Panel module:

- `src/features/wearables/panel-datos-wearables/PanelDatosWearablesPage.tsx`
- `src/features/wearables/panel-datos-wearables/panelDatosWearablesApi.ts`
- `src/features/wearables/panel-datos-wearables/components/DashboardMetricas.tsx`
- `src/features/wearables/panel-datos-wearables/components/GraficosPasos.tsx`
- `src/features/wearables/panel-datos-wearables/components/GraficosSueno.tsx`
- `src/features/wearables/panel-datos-wearables/components/GraficosFrecuencia.tsx`
- `src/features/wearables/panel-datos-wearables/components/ResumenSemanal.tsx`

Each `.tsx` file contains a basic React component structure with placeholder content, and `panelDatosWearablesApi.ts` includes mock data as requested. The `write_file` tool handled the creation of the necessary parent directories.

Let me know if you need any further modifications or additional files.
