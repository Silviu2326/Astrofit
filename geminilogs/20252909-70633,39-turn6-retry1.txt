Okay, I will complete and improve the `PanelPropiedades.tsx` component. First, I need to locate the component.Got the component path. Reading the file to see how to improve it.This is a good start, but incomplete. I'll add full state management to the settings components, making them controlled and dynamic. `ConditionSettings` needs a complete overhaul to handle multiple, groupable conditions. I'll also implement real-time validation with error messages, add a `TriggerSettings` component, and include an explicit "Save" button for better UX. My plan is to refactor the settings components, enhance `ConditionSettings`, create `TriggerSettings`, update the `nodeSettingsMap`, implement live validation, and finally, modify the main `PanelPropiedades` component to integrate these changes. I'll now rewrite the file to implement this.I've rewritten `PanelPropiedades.tsx`, improving it with state-driven settings, a dynamic `ConditionSettings` panel, and real-time validation. A `TriggerSettings` component has been added. The UX is enhanced with disabled action buttons on validation errors, clearer feedback, a cleaner structure, and better use of icons and tooltips. State is now managed internally and synced to the global store on "Save." The component is now a complete and robust configuration panel. Next, I'll check `package.json` for `lucide-react` and `framer-motion` dependencies.Right, I'll check the project's `package.json` for dependencies.`framer-motion` and `lucide-react` are dependencies, so no installation is needed. I've completed the `PanelPropiedades.tsx` component as requested, rewriting it with state-driven logic, real-time validation, a dynamic conditions UI, and improved UX after assessing the existing file and identifying areas for enhancement. The task is done; awaiting further instructions.
