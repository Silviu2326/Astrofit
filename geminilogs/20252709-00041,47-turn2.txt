Okay, I will create the complete structure for the CRM - Lead Detail module. First, I'll create the necessary directories and then populate them with the specified files, including realistic mock data and adhering to the technical requirements.Directory already exists. Proceeding to create the files.I messed up; relative paths won't work. I'll fix it by getting the current directory, building the absolute paths for all files, and then writing them individually.`pwd` isn't for Windows. I'll use `cd` instead.Right, `C:\Users\usuario\Documents` is the directory. I'll create the files with absolute paths now, starting with `leadDetalleApi.ts`.Okay, first file's done. Now, `LeadHeader.tsx`.Okay, `LeadHeader.tsx` is done. Next up: `LeadQualification.tsx`.Okay, `LeadQualification.tsx` is finished. Now, `LeadTimeline.tsx`.Okay, `LeadTimeline.tsx` is done. Time for `LeadConversion.tsx`.Okay, `LeadConversion.tsx` is finished. Now to create the `LeadDetallePage.tsx` component.
I have created all the requested files for the CRM - Lead Detail module. The structure is now complete.
